/* INTERSECT operator 
The INTERSECT operator is a set operator that returns only distinct rows of two queries or more queries.
The INTERSECT operator compares the result sets of two queries and returns the distinct rows that are output by both queries.
 Unfortunately, MySQL does not support the INTERSECT operator. However, you can emulate the INTERSECTÂ operator. */
